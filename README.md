# Revision Central

Welcome to the repo where my website is currently being hosted. 
This repo has gone through many nukes, iterations, revisions, you name it.

With that being said, each version of my website seems to be getting better and I hope this current version follows suite.
The last version used Bootstrap which required me to write no css whatsoever (^_^). 

Accordingly, I did not really know how to use css, and using Bootstrap felt overboard for a small website such as this portfolio. 
As such, I decided to challenge myself in making a better website without a framework and this was the result. 

Feel free to send a message my way with any feedback you got! 

Thank you for your time!
